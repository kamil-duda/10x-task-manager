## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components in React only when interactivity is needed

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus-visible:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Guidelines for Astro

- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions (use ClientRouter)
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Use POST, GET  - uppercase format for endpoint handlers
- Use `export const prerender = false` for API routes
- Use zod for input validation in API routes
- Extract logic into services in `src/lib/services`
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables

### Guidelines for React

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Never use "use client" and other Next.js directives as we use React with Astro
- Extract logic into custom hooks in `src/components/hooks`
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
- Use SupabaseClient type from `src/db/supabase.client.ts`, not from `@supabase/supabase-js`

## Database: Create migration

You are a Postgres Expert who loves creating secure database schemas.

This project uses the migrations provided by the Supabase CLI.

### Creating a migration file

Given the context of the user's message, create a database migration file inside the folder `supabase/migrations/`.

The file MUST following this naming convention:

The file MUST be named in the format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` with proper casing for months, minutes, and seconds in UTC time:

1. `YYYY` - Four digits for the year (e.g., `2024`).
2. `MM` - Two digits for the month (01 to 12).
3. `DD` - Two digits for the day of the month (01 to 31).
4. `HH` - Two digits for the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).
5. `mm` - Two digits for the minute (00 to 59).
6. `ss` - Two digits for the second (00 to 59).
7. Add an appropriate description for the migration.

For example:

```
20240906123045_create_profiles.sql
```

### SQL Guidelines

Write Postgres-compatible SQL code for Supabase migration files that:

- Includes a header comment with metadata about the migration, such as the purpose, affected tables/columns, and any special considerations.
- Includes thorough comments explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each migration step.
- Write all SQL in lowercase.
- Add copious comments for any destructive SQL commands, including truncating, dropping, or column alterations.
- When creating a new table, you MUST enable Row Level Security (RLS) even if the table is intended for public access.
- When creating RLS Policies
    - Ensure the policies cover all relevant access scenarios (e.g. select, insert, update, delete) based on the table's purpose and data sensitivity.
    - If the table  is intended for public access the policy can simply return `true`.
    - RLS Policies should be granular: one policy for `select`, one for `insert` etc) and for each supabase role (`anon` and `authenticated`). DO NOT combine Policies even if the functionality is the same for both roles.
    - Include comments explaining the rationale and intended behavior of each security policy

The generated SQL code should be production-ready, well-documented, and aligned with Supabase's best practices.

## Supabase Astro Initialization

This document provides a reproducible guide to create the necessary file structure for integrating Supabase with your Astro project.

### Prerequisites

- Your project should use Astro 5, TypeScript 5, React 19, and Tailwind 4.
- Install the `@supabase/supabase-js` package.
- Ensure that `/supabase/config.toml` exists
- Ensure that a file `/src/db/database.types.ts` exists and contains the correct type definitions for your database.

IMPORTANT: Check prerequisites before perfoming actions below. If they're not met, stop and ask a user for the fix.

### File Structure and Setup

#### 1. Supabase Client Initialization

Create the file `/src/db/supabase.client.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

import type { Database } from '../db/database.types.ts';

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.SUPABASE_KEY;

export const supabaseClient = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

This file initializes the Supabase client using the environment variables `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.


#### 2. Middleware Setup

Create the file `/src/middleware/index.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';

import { supabaseClient } from '../db/supabase.client.ts';

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware((context, next) => {
  context.locals.supabase = supabaseClient;
  return next();
});
```

This middleware adds the Supabase client to the Astro context locals, making it available throughout your application.


#### 3. TypeScript Environment Definitions

Create the file `src/env.d.ts` with the following content:

```ts
/// <reference types="astro/client" />

import type { SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import type { Database } from './db/database.types.ts';

declare global {
  namespace App {
    interface Locals {
      supabase: SupabaseClient<Database>;
    }
  }
}

interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly SUPABASE_URL: string;
  readonly SUPABASE_KEY: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```

This file augments the global types to include the Supabase client on the Astro `App.Locals` object, ensuring proper typing throughout your application.

## Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for user interface components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that can be customized for your application.

### Finding Installed Components

Components are available in the `src/components/ui` folder, according to the aliases defined in the `components.json` file.

### Using Components

Import components according to the configured alias `@/`

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs"
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

Example component usage:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

### Installing Additional Components

Many other components are available, but they are not currently installed. The full list can be found at https://ui.shadcn.com/r

To install a new component, use the shadcn CLI


```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the accordion component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

Important: `npx shadcn-ui@latest` has been deprecated, use `npx shadcn@latest`

Some popular components include:

- Accordion
- Alert
- AlertDialog
- AspectRatio
- Avatar
- Calendar
- Checkbox
- Collapsible
- Command
- ContextMenu
- DataTable
